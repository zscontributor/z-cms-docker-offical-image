-- Z-CMS bootstraps TWO Postgres roles, and the split is what makes Row-Level
-- Security actually enforceable:
--
--   zcms      (owner)  - owns every table, runs migrations and seeds.
--                        A table owner is NOT subject to its own RLS policies
--                        unless FORCE is set, so this role can move freely.
--                        Used by the "system" client for cross-tenant work
--                        (login by email, domain -> site resolution).
--
--   zcms_app  (runtime) - owns nothing. Every request from cms-api uses this
--                        role, so RLS policies are always applied. Even a query
--                        where a developer forgot `where: { tenantId }` cannot
--                        leak another tenant's rows.
--
-- If the API ever connects as `zcms`, tenant isolation silently disappears.
-- That is the single most important invariant in this file.
--
-- This file is mounted into the Postgres container at
-- /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d and runs ONCE, on the very first boot of an empty
-- data volume. It is NOT re-run on later boots. The app role name/password below
-- must therefore match APP_DB_USER / APP_DB_PASSWORD in your .env. The app role
-- is only ever reachable from inside the Docker network (Postgres is not
-- published to the internet), so its password is a network-internal value.
